<h1>A Framework for Serendipity</h1>

<p>This website is the result of our PhD research which proposes the creation of a methodological framework for the design of interactive systems that allow and encourage valuable and unpredictable—viz serendipitous—encounters in the digital medium, expanding on its ability for the discovery of novel information, for enabling unfamiliar experiences, and supporting creative practices.</p>

<p>The current trajectory of the design of interactive systems aims for increased optimisation and personalisation of digital experiences which, while situationally apropos, when universally adopted hamper the scope and potential of the digital medium, limiting its reach to the systems’ constructed persona of the interactor. Considering the role digital media plays in contemporary life, we believe that by designing towards serendipity, we permit not just optimum interactions in the digital medium but also the wide breadth of human experience. To that end we establish a theoretically-grounded understanding of serendipity, identifying its fundamental concepts and domains. We propose a framework composed by three identified vectors: <a href="#HumanFactors">Human Factors</a>, <a href="#HumanActivities">Human Activities</a>, and <a href="#Heuristics">Heuristics</a> which, through their articulation and interplay, define both a model for the development of serendipitous systems, as well as the analysis of existing ones.</p>

<p>Through the established understanding of serendipity and the developed framework, we not only aim for enabling the design of serendipitous systems, but also to alert for necessity and significance of serendipity itself, to both designers and interactors of the digital medium.</p>
